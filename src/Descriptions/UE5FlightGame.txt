A flight game project I have been working on for the past year, made in Unreal Engine 5 and coded with mostly C++. 
As of right now the project has some of the flight mechanics that I want to keep, such as the AOA mechanic
and basic air controls, however mechanics like thrust and stalling I haven't yet got up. 
A real challenge of this project has been my computer, as it doesn't run Unreal Engine 5 the best and really requires me to care about every single tick and 
graphical expendetures. In order to combat this, I switched most things about my project to C++ and routinely 
checked for tasks that I could place elsewhere to prevent it from being ran too often, increasing performance on my computer.
This project has also taught me to improve code now instead of later in order to prevent more time taken on trying to fix bugs or implement something new.
Countless times I have done a task, which I would then practically remove as I had thought of a better way of handling it, whether it be scalability
or reliability, which took time out now but would definitely save a lot of time in the future.
I've also gained experience with Blender and Photoshop through working on this project.
