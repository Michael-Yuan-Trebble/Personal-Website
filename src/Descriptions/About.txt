Hi, I'm Michael, and I am a third year Computer Science major at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, with a planned minor in Physics. I'm passionate about aerospace software,
embedded systems, and simulation, and I enjoy expanding my programming skills in low-level languages such as C++.

One of my biggest personal projects is a flight simulator I'm actively developing in Unreal Engine 5. 
Some notable information about the project are:
- Written in C++ 14 with some additional Blueprint scripting
- Aircraft modeling and effects made in Blender and Photoshop
- Implementation of Angle of Attack and linked Data Assets for easy Aircraft implementation and customization

Through this project I have learned efficient logic organization, resource management, and per-tick computation in Unreal Engine 5.

Some information about my setup:
- IDEs: Visual Studio 2022, VS Code
- OS: Windows 11 (primary), Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Primary Languages: C/C++ and Python

DISCLAIMER
Due to my university's academic policy, I am unable to publically share my code for assignments I have worked on, which are mostly coded in C.

Some of my previous experience involves:
OIT Consultant - Rutgers University Office of Information Technology
