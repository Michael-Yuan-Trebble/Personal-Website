Hi, I'm Michael, I am a third year Computer Science major at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, with a planned minor in Physics.
I'm passionate about expanding my programming skills, whether it be refining the current languages I know or expanding my catalog.

One of my biggest personal projects is a flight simulator I'm actively developing in Unreal Engine 5. 
It is written primarily in C++ with a bit of Blueprint scripting and the models and effects are created in Blender.
This project has tested my technical skills and creativity, most noteably challenging my optimization skills due to the engine being very resource intensive.

Outside of coursework and projects, I love tackling new coding challenges, exploring new emerging technologies, and playing around with different development tools.
