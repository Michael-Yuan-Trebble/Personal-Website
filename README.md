# Personal-Website

A personal portfolio website for me to showcase my projects, courses, and certifications. My goal is to learn React.js and its futures and eventually publish it online.

## Features
Currently there are 4 tabs, about, projects, coursework, and contact.

### About
Very simple bio page describing who I am and necessary information, I plan to eventually add some pictures and feature some of my top projects that really show what I am about. Also have some information just generally about me.

### Projects
Personal projects that show an image of the project, description of what it is, and a link to the github repository. Projects also have a unseen tag so that the user can see specific projects using either a specific language or tool.
Example: Can sort based on C++ and see if there is a project using Unreal Engine 5, however if the tool they select is PyQt5, a nothing found filler is given.

### Coursework
Same structure as projects, however not every single one has a github repository attached, so there is no link area.

### Contact
All the necessary links to get in contact, currently there is an email and linkin profile (not shown in build).

## Purpose
I built this website in order to:
- Learn React and the workflow around it
- Create a central page for my portfolio projects
- Get a hold on UI/UX concepts
- Learn how to integrate Tailwind CSS into a React project

## Features
Some of the features in my website are:
- Projects and Coursework showcase tab with Github links when possible
- About Me and Contact area
- Collapsable projects

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
